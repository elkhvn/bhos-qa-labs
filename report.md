# Analysis of results


The results of load testing revealed that the binary search algorithm outperforms the linear search strategy.


The linear search method detected the first faulty version (8794) among the 10000 variants in 147 milliseconds in the first load test.
The binary search technique, on the other hand, took just 86 milliseconds to complete, which is nearly twice as quick.


The linear search method iterates over all input data until it finds the correct answer, which explains the performance disparity.
It has an O time complexity (n).
Binary search, on the other hand, doubles the search space every time, and the time complexity is O. (logn).
