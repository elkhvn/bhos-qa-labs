# Line/Branch Coverage
The Line Coverage of a program is the number of executed lines divided by the total number of lines. Only lines that contain executable statements are considered, not those with pure declarations.

Branch coverage is a useful indicator for determining whether or not an application has been fully tested. A poor branch coverage indicates that there are possibilities in the application that haven't been properly tested. When the application reaches production, such scenarios may contain faults that will only show up in rare circumstances. 

In our Lab3 and Lab4, we used **SonarCLoud** tool which is cloud-based code quality and security service. This free tool generates a static analysis of a project's code, identifying bad practices, potential errors, and bugs. This detection is based on a set of configurable rules that the tool will use to review and analyze all of your project's code before creating a final report that can be viewed immediately on the web.
